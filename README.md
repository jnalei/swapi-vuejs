# Display data from Star Wars API 

## Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my project! This is a single page application which displays data from a public API using JavaScript and the VueJS framework (my first project using VueJS.) We will be loading data from [https://swapi.dev/api/planets/](https://swapi.dev/api/planets/) and it will be displayed in a basic table format. 

Please follow the details below to run the application on your local environment.


## Instructions
Once you have copied this project repo from GitHub, run the following commands in the repo's directory using your computer's terminal.

### Install dependencies using NPM (Node Package Manager)
```
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, we will run the application using [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve). This compiles and hot-reloads for development.
```
npm run serve
```

The application is now running locally, navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to see it in action.
