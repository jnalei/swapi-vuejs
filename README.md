# Display data from Star Wars API 

## Introduction
Welcome to my project! This is a single page application using JavaScript and the VueJS framework. We will be loading data about Star Wars planets from [https://swapi.dev/api/planets/](https://swapi.dev/api/planets/) and this data will be displayed in a basic table format. 
Please follow the instructions below to run the application on your local environment.


## Instructions
Once you have copied the project repo from GitHub, run the following commands in the repo's directory using your computer's terminal.

### Install dependencies using NPM (Node Package Manager)
```
npm install
```

Once it has completed its installation, we will run the application using [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve). This compiles and hot-reloads for development.
```
npm run serve
```
The application is now running locally, navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to see it in action.



### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
